			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
			  
			  <h4 class= "text-primary">Colors</h4>
			  
			  <p>A nice, quick option to have in Bootstrap is the color classes. First, you put the object name that your are changing the color of
				and then a dash. After that you can choose which predefined colors. For example, the body background has the class "bg-danger" which is red
				, the background of the footer is black from a class "bg-dark", and the Colors title above is blue from "text-primary".</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
			  <h4>Spacing</h4>
			  
			  <p>Being able to change the margin spacing and padding of containers and text with just a couple of letters and dashes is so useful.
				The margin class starts with the letter "m" while the padding class has a "p". There is also the option to just change the top, right, bottom, or left spacing 
				by putting t, r, b, or l next to the first letter. Then comes a dash, and then number from 1 to 5, smallest to biggest spacing. There is also the optional area in between to indicate that it should act responsively (mt-*-#).
				Some examples of my spacing is in this body container, I have classes "mb-5" and "mt-4" to give margin spacing on top and bottom.
				In my footer below, I have the class "p-3" to give some padding to the text.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
				  <h5>Navbar</h5>
				  <p> The Navbar that is displayed above has many different capabilities designed just for it. One class is "navbar-brand" which is on the left of the navbar and displays the brand name of the site.
						My favorite class is the "collapse navbar-collapse" combined with a "navbar-toggler" button which allows the navbar to collapse and open from a button when the screen is too small.
						Another coloring class that goes with the navbar is "navbar-dark" which just adjusts the bar to black and text to white.
					</p>
			  </div>
			  
			  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
				  
				  <h5>Grid</h5>
				  <p> One of the best parts about Bootstrap is the ability to lay objects on a grid and position easily.
					To start the grid, first, a "container" div class needs to be made to wrap around the grid.
					Then a table structure must be made by making a "row" div class and then multiple column classes.
					The column class syntax goes like "col-sm-12". The middle part represents the screen size, and the number is the size. Each row width is 12 spaces wide, so for example, this row has
					3 div columns that are 4 spaces wide each on a large screen, or "col-lg-4". The total of each row should add up to 12 if you want the entire page to be filled.
					</p>
			  </div>
			  
			  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
				  
				  <h5>Images</h5>
				  <p>Images are an important part of creating websites, and Bootstrap makes it even easier to use them. Bootstrap is all about responsive websites.
					The class "img-responsive" allows the picture to resize if it needs to when the screen size changes.
					Another class I used on my images is the "img-thumbnail" class to give a nice predesigned border and pleasing look to my photos.

			  <h2>Using Bootstrap instead of Wordpress<h2>
			  <img src="bootstrapimg.png" alt="Bootstrap" class="img-responsive">
			  <h4 class= "text-success">Pros</h4>
			  
			  <p>Bootstrap is used for web responsive development and easily allows the creator to design a website for mobile and PC.
				Even though Wordpress does it too, Bootstrap gives more freedom to do what you want and get complete responsiveness. The big benefit for me is that Bootstrap is similar to
				HTML and CSS which is syntax and designing tools that I have already learned, and made it easier to pickup. Wordpress, and all site builders, are newer to me and when
				I didn't know how to do something, it was more difficult to look it up, or it wasn't possible. So the main benifits of using Bootstrap over Wordpress is that it gives 
				more freedom to the creator and it was easier to pickup for me as a Computer Science Major.
			  </p>
				<br>
			  <h4 class= "text-danger">Cons</h4>
			  
			  <p>A benifit for me can be a negative to others I suppose. Coding is a lot more complicated to others and Wordpress would be better for them than learning HTML and Bootstrap.
				Also, site builders for simple websites are really quick compared to Bootstrap when making a site from scratch. Wordpress also has templates to take from and gives a headstart to creating the site.
				Another con about using Bootstrap over Wordpress is that it doesn't automatically come with a bunch of data tracking gadgets like knowing how much views, visitors, and followers that your site has.
				Wordpress also gives you a free "real" domain and allows your site to be out on the web while if I didn't have the University's servers my site would just be a file.
